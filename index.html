                    <strong>Early life</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara in Stone Town in the British protectorate of Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania) on 5 September 1946.<br /> 
                    His parents, Bomi (1908–2003) and Jer Bulsara (1922–2016), were from the Parsi community of western India. <br />
                    The Bulsaras had origins in the city of Bulsar (now Valsad) in Gujarat.<br /> 
                    He had a younger sister, Kashmira.<br /><br />

                    The family had moved to Zanzibar so that Bomi could continue his job as a cashier at the British Colonial Office. <br />
                    As Parsis, the Bulsaras practised Zoroastrianism. <br /> 
                    Mercury was born with four supernumerary incisors, to which he attributed his enhanced vocal range.<br />
                    As Zanzibar was a British protectorate until 1963, Mercury was born a British subject, and on 2 June 1969 was registered a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies after the family had emigrated to England.<br /><br />

                    Although Mercury's speaking voice naturally fell in the baritone range, he delivered most songs in the tenor range.<br />
                    His known vocal range extended from bass low F (F2) to soprano high F (F6).<br />
                    He could belt up to tenor high F (F5).<br />
                    Biographer David Bret described his voice as "escalating within a few bars from a deep, throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a high-pitched, perfect coloratura, pure and crystalline in the upper reaches".<br />
                    Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé, with whom Mercury recorded an album, expressed her opinion that "the difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars was that he was selling the voice".<br /><br />

                        <dd>
                            His technique was astonishing.<br />
                            No problem of tempo, he sang with an incisive sense of rhythm, his vocal placement was very good and he was able to glide effortlessly from a register to another.<br />
                            He also had a great musicality.<br />
                            His phrasing was subtle, delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming.<br />
                            He was able to find the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word.

                    In 2003 Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame with the rest of Queen, <br />
                    and in 2005 all four band members were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.<br /><br />

                    Mercury was noted for his live performances, which were often delivered to stadium audiences around the world. <br />
                    He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked a great deal of participation from the crowd.<br />
                    A writer for The Spectator described him as "a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself."<br />
                    David Bowie, who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song "Under Pressure" with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, <br />
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Saying:</dt>
                        <dd>"Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest ... he took it over the edge.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights.<br />
                    I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand.<br />
                    " Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make "the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected".<br />
                    Mercury's main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand; after accidentally snapping it off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised it could be used in endless ways.<br /><br />

                <li>
                    As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano training up to the age of nine. <br />
                    Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. <br />
                    Much of the music he liked was guitar-orientated: his favourite artists at the time were the Who, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. <br />
                    He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments. <br />
                    However Brian May states Mercury "had a wonderful touch on the piano. <br />
                    He could play what came from inside him like nobody else – incredible rhythm, incredible passion and feeling.<br />
                    "Keyboardist Rick Wakeman praised Mercury's playing style, saying he "discovered [the piano] for himself" and successfully composed a number of Queen songs on the instrument.<br /> 
                    From the early 1980s Mercury began extensively using guest keyboardists.<br />
                    Most notably, he enlisted Fred Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John, and Supertramp) for his first solo project. <br />
                    From 1982 Mercury collaborated with Morgan Fisher (who performed with Queen in concert during the Hot Space leg), and from 1985 onward Mercury collaborated with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney (in concert).<br /><br />

                <li>
                    As well as his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo albums and several singles. <br />
                    Although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most Queen albums, the two off-Queen albums and several of the singles debuted in the top 10 of the UK Music Charts. <br />
                    His first solo effort goes back to 1972 under the pseudonym Larry Lurex, when Trident Studios' house engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable was working in a musical project, at the time when Queen were recording their debut album;<br />
                    Cable enlisted Mercury to perform lead vocals on the songs "I Can Hear Music" and "Goin' Back", both were released together as a single in 1973. <br />
                    Eleven years later, Mercury contributed to the soundtrack for the restoration of the 1927 Fritz Lang film Metropolis.<br />
                    "Love Kills" was written for the film by Giorgio Moroder in collaboration with Mercury, and produced by Moroder and Mack; in 1984 it debuted at the number 10 position in the UK Singles Chart.<br /><br />
